# liri-node-app

## Descripion

-   Welcome to Lucy's Liri.
    LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

## Conflicts & Solution
-   Dealing with multiple npm packages, taking it in user input and using those to bring back data, displaying     data, and logging data was difficult as multiple tasks were handled. 
    Creating flow chart and tasklist(below) before starting coding gave solid guideline to follow and to resolve any conflicts

## Task List
-   [x] create github repository 
-   [x] initialize package.json file
-   [x] make .gitignore
-   [x] make keys.js
-   [x] make .env file
-   [x] make random.txt
-   [x] make liri.js
-   [x] add packages that are necessary to lirijs.
-   [x] 4 commands:
    *   concert-this
    *   spotify-this-song
    *   movie-this
    *   do-what-it-says
-   [x] output the data to log.txt(no overriding, but appending)
-   [x] readme
-   [x] add to porfolio
-   [x] submit screenshots and link to repo

## Techinical Approach
-   node, api, objects, npm packages

## Future
-   Display data with more design and structure rather than consologgin the data. (frontend/user interface         improvement)
